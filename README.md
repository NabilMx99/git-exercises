## Tag It

You are developing an application and **initially released it as version** `0.1.0`. After adding new functionality, you decided to **release a new version**.

The goal of this exercise is to **commit the new functionality** and **tag it** as `v0.2.0`, marking a new release of the application.

> Tip: Ensure the tag name is exactly `v0.2.0`; otherwise, the exercise will be marked as failed.
